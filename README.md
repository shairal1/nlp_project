# Financial PhraseBank Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on the Financial PhraseBank dataset using NLP and machine learning techniques. It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Text pre-processing and cleaning
- Sentiment classification using machine learning
- Semantic similarity analysis using word vectors

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run EDA and analysis scripts:**
   - `task1.py`: Exploratory data analysis and visualization
   - `task2.py`: Text pre-processing
   - `task3.py`: Sentiment classification
   - `task4.py`: Semantic similarity analysis

3. **Data:**
   - Place the Financial PhraseBank data files in the `data/` directory.

## Notes
- Visualizations and results are saved task wise.
- For GloVe-based similarity, download GloVe embeddings from [nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
